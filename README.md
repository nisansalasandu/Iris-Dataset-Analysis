# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the **Iris dataset** using Python.
It includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **data visualization** using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.


## Details

**Prepared by:** Ruwan Pathiranage Sanduni Nisansala
**Project:** Data Cleaning, EDA, and Visualization


## Tools Used

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* VS Code


## Tasks

### Task 1 – Data Cleaning

* Loaded the dataset using pandas
* Checked for missing values and duplicates
* Removed duplicates
* Saved the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_iris.csv`

### Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis

* Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation
* Created histograms, box plots, and scatter plots
* Found correlations between numerical features

### Task 3 – Visualization

* Created bar plots, line charts, and scatter plots
* Added labels, titles, and legends
* Saved all plots as images


## Key Findings

* No missing values or duplicates
* Strong positive correlation between petal length and width
* Setosa species is clearly separated from others
* Petal features are best for identifying species


## Visuals

* Histogram
* Box Plot
* Scatter Plot (Sepal & Petal)
* Bar Chart (Species Count)
* Line Chart
* Correlation Heatmap


## Conclusion

This project shows the full process of analyzing a dataset — cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data.
The Iris dataset helped to understand basic data science steps, which are useful for more advanced tasks like machine learning.
